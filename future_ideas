MORE SINGLEPLAYER CONTENT
-------------------------

> WAVE SURVIVAL (medium)
Probably easier to implement than full bots since they wouldn't need base building
Use logic from spawning animals for finding spawn locations
Once spawned, repeatedly attack move towards your base
Difficulty settings based on time allowed to prep each day:
    - easy = 10mins (vanilla)
    - medium = 8mins
    - hard = 6mins
Set maps and borders like the tutorial to prevent terrain cheesing (eg. starting on an island)
    - Or just give all the enemy mobs frostwalker?
Endless, until you eventually die or lag out

> BOTS (hard)
Retrofit some code from the tutorial logic
Need to generalise unit actions and make sure they're reliable (eg. repeating movement incase units get stuck)
Should be able work against multiple real players and other bots too





Other new units
---------------
PIGLINS: Magma cubes (research make melee attacks set enemies on fire)
    - comes from mother cube building - giant building that looks exactly like a magma cube
VILLAGERS: Illusioner - create illusions ability, confusion (temporarily makes a unit neutral)
    - comes from new supplementary building ala-library



VANILLA PLAYER INTEGRATION
--------------------------
Must first solve issue of lag in fog of war when in vanilla cam

Changes required for any implementation:
-----------------------------------------
- Attacking any melee unit that's targeting a player should immediately deal its melee damage to them
    - Otherwise, kiting melee units is too easy
- Block placement is disabled
- Block breaking only allowed for gathering resources and attacking buildings


Vagabond
--------
Inspired by the Raccoon from the boardgame Root, where each survival player is on their own team



RTS Commander
-------------
Inspired by the game Natural Selection, where each RTS player is a commander for their team of survival players and they can support each other
