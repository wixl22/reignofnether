1.19.2-1.0.4
------------

[‚úî] Done and tested
[üü°] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[‚ùå] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority

Bugfixes
--------
[‚úî] Fixed Azalea and Flowering Azalea leaves not being nether-converted

[‚úî] Regular TNT can now damage buildings with the same damage as regular creepers (20) and can set off other TNTs

[‚úî] Having many buildings selected no longer has messed up HUD rendering

[‚úî] Crimson and Warped Hyphae are now gatherable by workers

[‚úî] Planks and stripped logs are no longer gatherable by workers and will no longer chain-break when broken in the air
    The only gatherable and chain-breakable blocks are now logs, wood blocks and mushroom/wart stems

[‚úî] Units in production queues now pause at 99% in red text if you dropped below max population while it was building

[‚úî] Non-ops can no longer use /rts-reset

[‚úî] Resources no longer act strangely (go negative, have doubled costs, etc.) after a match is restarted or a player is defeated

[‚úî] Research buttons no longer disappear if someone else of the same faction is researching it at the time

[‚úî] Joining a match no longer causes everyone's clientside buildings to be duplicated (this was causing population issues)


[‚ùå] Ranged units in garrisons should deaggro targets out of range and aggro targets they can actually reach instead

[‚ùå] Let mapmakers set the default Y level of their world and have it sync to clients on login
    - This solves rendering issues on worlds where the default is far from Y=64

[‚ùå] Building on top of a unit causes crash
    - probably because of moving out of the way logic
    - need crash logs

[‚ùå] Water in farms no longer freeze up

[‚ùå] Iron golems attack your villagers sometimes
    - Maybe because they're actually vindicators in a villager skin?

[‚ùå] Joining a world causes a lot of lag if a match is already started
    - Create an experimental branch where building syncing is toggleable
    - Will need volunteer helpers to test
    - Review code and see if direct optimisations can be made
    - Maybe can buffer the syncing (eg. only allow 1 building sync per second, across all players) so it doesn't collapse the server

[‚ùå] On a server, unloaded workers stop gathering stuff
    - Relook at forced chunks?



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[‚úî] New command: /rts-lock enable/disable to prevent new players joining the match
    - /rts-reset will automatically unlock the match too
    - change to enable/disable

[‚úî] New experimental command: /rts-syncing enable/disable
    - Prevents anyone logging in from syncing from server data, and from joining the RTS match, even if the game is unlocked
    - New joiners will not be able to select buildings and units will appear neutral until the syncing is re-enabled and they relog
    - This also affects existing RTS players who relog, so use at your discretion
    - This is a temporary measure to (in theory) prevent login lag spikes until a permanent solution is found

[‚úî] Pressing alt now cancels your building placement so you don't accidentally place it while dragging the camera

[‚úî] Vanilla players can now drop off resources into stockpile chests (and chests for this purpose have been added to civilian portals)
    - This was actually designed previously, just was only working for villager stockpiles until now

[‚úî] New cheat code: thereisnospoon X - sets everyone's hard capped max population to X
    - The current max value is now shown on the tooltip to the left of the bed icon
    - Like most other cheats, this won't save between server restarts
    - foodforthought now allows you to only ignore the soft cap (ie. houses are no longer needed),
       but cannot go higher than what has been set with thereisnospoon


[‚ùå] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night
    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)

[‚ùå] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[‚ùå] More shift click queue commands
    - Build already-placed foundations
    - Repair damaged buildings
    - Move units

[‚ùå] Hovering buttons (or some other indicator) for idle farms
    - Clicking said button will assign the nearest idle villager to it


Balancing
---------
[‚úî] Any explosive damage to a garrison now deals a random amount that damage directly to all garrisoned units
    (This averages out to 1/2 of the explosion damage)

[‚úî] Reduced ghast health from 60 to 50 to compensate for the above

[üü°] Garrison units should be attackable by ground ranged units but only at 1/2 accuracy
    - Implement the nophysics mixin for arrows and blaze fireballs but have it not work 1/2 of the time
        - Turns out its kinda hard to do make arrows noclip the battlements but also collide with enemies






TODO BACKLOG
------------

Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
- beehives are not gatherable
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
